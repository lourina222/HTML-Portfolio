  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>In my life, I've gained diverse experiences spanning my academic journey, social work engagements, and active participation in various organizations. Here are some of the key milestones:</p>
  <h3>Physics Competition:</h3>
  <p>In my third secondary year, I immersed myself in the intense preparation for the Fergani International Physics Olympiad.

Through disciplined self-study, late-night sessions, and mentor guidance, I emerged victorious, securing the first-place position in Egypt. This experience showcased my resilience and strategic planning abilities.</p>

  <h3>USAID Scholarship:</h3>
  <p>Post-high school, I embarked on the application process for the USAID scholarship, a significant milestone in my academic journey. The USAID scholarship has been transformative, honing my teamwork and communication skills through leadership, English proficiency, and entrepreneurship programs. Engaging in diverse initiatives broadened my perspectives and strategic thinking. The challenges I faced, such as spending two weeks away from my parents after every semester and preparing for my first presentation, prompted focused self-improvement. This experience has profoundly changed me, providing insights into my strengths, weaknesses, and overall personal development.</p>
  <h3>GDSC MTI (Google Developer Student Clubs - Modern Technology Institute):</h3>
  <p>As an active member of GDSC MTI, I've consistently contributed to the club's objectives. Recognition as the "Best Member" multiple times, along with organizing successful events like "Roya" and "Devfest," demonstrates my commitment to fostering a vibrant community of technology enthusiasts. These experiences have allowed me to further develop organizational and leadership skills within the tech community.</p>
  <h3>Electro Pi:</h3>
  <p>Serving as a PR Member Intern at Electro Pi, I engaged in various responsibilities, including successful partnership development and securing a sponsor for the company.
